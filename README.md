# fabric-defects-detection
A detection model for fabric defects based on deep Cascade R-CNN is proposed, focusing on the substantive difficulties such as the increase of hard examples caused by various patterns and varieties of defects.<br>

# Requirements
Python3.7, Pytorch 1.1.0 and other comman packages listed in requirements.txt.<br>
Install and compile mmdetection from <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>.<br>
Download project from <https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP> to caluculate mAP.<br>
You can get fabric dataset and pretrained weight from <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TDBU5a5WPtr9kAdIIkvM-Q>, and the password is tlfz.
